This folder is used for code executions.
It contains on many simple python scripts, which were simple enough to be written in c++.

!Scripts are done in a way that they MUST be executted from the folder they are in!
!So, to execute for example "fire_preprocess.py" the terminal path we are in must be ../KM/App/EXECUTIONS!!
Otherwise, the scripts do not work
