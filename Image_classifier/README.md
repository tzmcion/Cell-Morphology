This small program writen with DearPyGui is used to classify the images to maximum of 4 different groups.
Be carefull! It leaks RAM memory somewhere (I couldn't find where, and I assume it is due to some arror with how dearpygui deletes the texture of image).
It works only on linux fedora :c, it is not a part of the project, but as I created it I leave it here as well.

To run it just execute main.py
